class LoadScopeScheduling:
    """Implement load scheduling across nodes, but grouping test by scope.

    This distributes the tests collected across all nodes so each test is run
    just once.  All nodes collect and submit the list of tests and when all
    collections are received it is verified they are identical collections.
    Then the collection gets divided up in work units, grouped by test scope,
    and those work units get submitted to nodes.  Whenever a node finishes an
    item, it calls ``.mark_test_complete()`` which will trigger the scheduler
    to assign more work units if the number of pending tests for the node falls
    below a low-watermark.

    When created, ``numnodes`` defines how many nodes are expected to submit a
    collection. This is used to know when all nodes have finished collection.

    Attributes:

    :numnodes: The expected number of nodes taking part.  The actual number of
       nodes will vary during the scheduler's lifetime as nodes are added by
       the DSession as they are brought up and removed either because of a dead
       node or normal shutdown.  This number is primarily used to know when the
       initial collection is completed.

    :collection: The final list of tests collected by all nodes once it is
       validated to be identical between all the nodes.  It is initialised to
       None until ``.schedule()`` is called.

    :workqueue: Ordered dictionary that maps all available scopes with their
       associated tests (nodeid). Nodeids are in turn associated with their
       completion status. One entry of the workqueue is called a work unit.
       In turn, a collection of work unit is called a workload.

            workqueue = {
                '<full>/<path>/<to>/test_module.py': {

                },
                (...)
            }

    :assigned_work: Ordered dictionary that maps worker nodes with their
       assigned work units.

            assigned_work = {
                '<worker node A>': {

                (...)

       their collection of tests gathered during test discovery.

       ::

            registered_collections = {
                '<worker node A>': [
